SQLFormatter
============

External SQL Formatter Utility Included with [Access SQL Editor](http://fieldeffect.info/wp/access-sql-editor-documentation/)

There is a Poor Man's T-SQL Formatter (PMTSF) plugin included with Access SQL Editor.  PMTSF is licensed under Affero GPL v3, and requires source code release.  The included plugin calls an external EXE to do the formatting, per the suggestion on the [website](http://architectshack.com/PoorMansTSqlFormatter.ashx#Tips_amp_Tricks_8):

`If you're the author of a SQL-related tool and you want to make use of the formatting library, but you don't want to release your project under the AGPL license, then you can always use the command-line formatter as an optional external tool. If you then redistribute the command-line tool you need to publish/provide the source of the formatter tool, but you don't need to relicense your project to match. Even simpler, you can suggest that users download the formatter separately to enable formatting functionality.`
